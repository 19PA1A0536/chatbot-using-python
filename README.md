Build a Chatbot with Python


# Introduction
Conversational NLP, or natural language processing, is playing a big part in text analytics through chatbots. A chatbot is an artificial intelligence based tool built to converse with humans in their native language. These chatbots have become popular across industries, and are considered one of the most useful applications of natural language processing. 

# Baseline Libraries
We are going to use the nltk library in this project. NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit and is a leading python library to work with text data. The first line of code below imports the library, while the second line uses the nltk.chat module to import the required utilities.The other import you did above was Reflections, which is a dictionary that contains a set of input text and its corresponding output values. You can examine the dictionary with the code below. This is an optional dictionary and you can create your own dictionary in the same format as below.

# Building the Chatbot
The first step is to create rules that will be used to train the chatbot. The lines of code below create a simple set of rules. The first element of the list is the user input, whereas the second element is the response from the bot. Several such lists are created in the set_pairs object.After creating the pairs of rules above, we define the chatbot using the code below. The code is simple and prints a message whenever the function is invoked.

# Conclusion
Her we  learned about creating a simple chatbot in Python. You used simple rules and the powerful nltk library to build the chatbot. More complex rules can be added to further strengthen the chatbot.
